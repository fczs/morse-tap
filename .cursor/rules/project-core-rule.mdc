1. Every important module has an AGENTS.md file that describes the specific module.
2. Always add to the context all AGENTS.md files from the affected modules.
3. Always add to the context the AGENTS.md file from the project root.
4. Do not add comments that narrate your actions, change history, or state the obvious. Write comments only to clarify non-obvious rationale, invariants, edge cases, important constraints, and performance/security caveats — anything that genuinely speeds up code analysis and maintenance.
5. Store every meta task description as a separate file under docs/meta-prompt/. Describe the problem statement, goals, and expected outcomes succinctly, avoiding implementation details; include links to related requirements or artefacts when available.
6. Derive each task-prompt from its meta-prompt and format it strictly per /.cursor/rules/task-prompt.mdc; keep task-prompt files in docs/task-prompt/, align their numbering with the source meta files, and update them when requirements evolve.
7. Do not create meta-prompt or task-prompt files unless the task explicitly requires generating them.
8. When a task explicitly limits work to preparing a meta-prompt or task-prompt, do not modify application code, components, styles, or configuration until a separate request allows it.
9. Do not create new AGENTS.md files unless the task explicitly requires generating them.
10. Follow MVVM architecture: Views should only handle UI, ViewModels contain presentation logic, Domain layer contains business logic.
11. Use Swift Concurrency (async/await) for asynchronous operations; avoid callbacks and Combine unless necessary.
12. All SwiftUI Views must have previews for development and testing.
